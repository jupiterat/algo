         * O(N*M) considering the array has N rows and M columns.
         * An important thing to remember is that for all the odd numbered diagonals, we will be processing the elements twice since we have to reverse the elements before adding to the result array.
         * Additionally, to save space, we have to clear the intermediate array before we process a new diagonal.
         * That operation also takes O(K) where K is the size of that array.
         * So, we will be processing all the elements of the array at least twice.
         * But, as far as the asymptotic complexity is concerned, it remains the same.
         *
         * Space Complexity:
         * O(min(N,M)) since the extra space is occupied by the intermediate arrays we use for storing diagonal elements and the maximum it can occupy is the equal to the minimum of N and M.
         * Remember, the diagonal can only extend till one of its indices goes out of scope.
